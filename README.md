# MSDS-6372-Project2

The goal of this project is to perform an EDA on one of three datasets:
1.	https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing Predicting if a customer will subscribe to a term deposit.
2.	https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult Predicting if someone makes over 50k
3.	R package aplore3, use the glow_bonemed data set.  Assessing risk factors and predicting if a woman with osteoperosis will have a bone fracture within the first year after joining the study. ?glow_bonemed for data description of variables.

Once a dataset has been explored, we will cover the following objectives:
1. Elaborate on EDA and initial trends/insights for the selected dataset.
2. Build a logistic regression model
3. Create additional models to compare performance metrics of initial logistic regression model for predictions.
